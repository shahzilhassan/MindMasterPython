Now we have game class i.e
                       Class game:
It contains func
mastermind4playerComputer(self):
self is argument

 print("welcome to 4 player vs computer/n")
        player_1 = player()
        player_1.get_players(4)
Above code is for 4 players vs computer
it calls player() function uptil to the 4 players.
one by one all 4 players give there code combinations
scheme.
        PegLength = 4
        trylength = 12
Above variables tell that Peglength is 4 and trylength
is 12

        solution_code = code.code_generator(self,PegLength)
        print("Computer code generated successfully/n/n")
Above code generating combination of colors
and second line prints Computer code generated successfully.

             for i in range(1, trylength+1):
                if (code.compute(self,player_1.p[x],i, trylength,x,3,solution_code))=='break':
                    break
Above code snippet checks 2nd player guess

                  
       	Func mastermind4player(self):
 This Func writes for 4 players.
 solution_code = code.get_code(self,lengthPegs)

Above line of code calls get_code function of code class which 
than checks players combination with computer generated combination.



 for i in range(1, trylength+1):
                    if (code.compute(self,player_1.p[x],i, trylength,x,3,solution_code))=='break':
                        break
                
Above code snippet give 12 attempts for player 
to guess
else it calls code.get_code function

		Func mastermind2(self):
This func writes for 2 players
This function simply calls get_code function of code class.

		Func mastermindl(self):
This func is written for 1 player.When 1 player 
plays with computer.

	solution_code = code.code_generator(self,lengthPegs)

Above line generate code by computer.



After this player have turn to guess code
