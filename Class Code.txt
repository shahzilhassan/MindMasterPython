Firstly all libraries are included 
random,collections,counter,getpass,os and sys
Than there is a list of available colors included
Red,Blue,Green,Yellow,Magenta and Cyan.

There is a 
                                                            CLASS CODE:
Having code_generator function,get_code function
Check_code function,compute function

                                                             Function: code_generator(self,pegs)

This function generate code for single player game
This func generate algorithm (how colors are arranged
i.e arrangement of colors).It uses while loop that 
runs from
0 to 5 and there is color variable using random function
for generating code of colors
This code is generated by computer.

                                                            Function get_code(self,l):
This function get code from player.There is a section 
of code which allow 1 player to generate code.
There is a 2nd player version which give 2 players to 
enter combination of colors.
There is section of code in get_code function which 
check length of "Enter code length combination"  
There is a section of code i.e

                                           if self.check_code(temp1)==1:
                                            solution_code = temp1
which check if input combination of color enter 
by player is subset of original color or not.

There is a 4 player version code

                                                      Function check_code(self,code);
This function check code enter by players using
 	flag = 0
        	if(set(code).issubset(set(colours))): 
            	    flag = 1
        		return flag

		Function compute(self,player_1,i,trylength,cur,max,solution_code):
This function matches computer code and player suggested code.
If code combination matches it displays message
Congratulations Player_1 broke the code in ... numbers of 
attempts 
else it gives feed back on players mistakes
